      <h1>History of Burnglade Creations</h1>
        <p>
            I've been playing table-top roleplaying games since around 2002–2003, when I started attending the local RPGA group’s Living Greyhawk 
            sessions at Domus Academica in Helsinki, where most of the older members of the local RPGA-branch were living at the time, and I have played every 
            edition of Dungeons & Dragons ever since, starting with 3rd edition, and as the group proceeded to the 3.5th edition update, I had little choice 
            other than tag along. Over the years, I have gathered extensive experience in the rules mechanics, rules interactions, and internal balance of 
            the game systems in the process (mostly with the aforementioned Dungeons & Dragons, but also some experience from White Wolf Publishing's Titles: "Exalted",
            "Mage: The Awakening", and "Werewolf", as well as Pathfinder 1st edition ever since beta playtest). Since late Pathfinder 1st edition, and approximately 
            a year after the release of Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition, in 2014, I started designing my own content (usually called as "Homebrew"), from full-blown 
            classes (e.g. the Warlord base class for 5th edition) and several subclasses (e.g. Thug and Inquisitor archetypes for 5th edition Rogue, as well Rage Mage 
            Primal Path for 5th edition Barbarian) to new rules mechanics themselves. In the advent of OneD&D playtest, I began my latest – and biggest – undertaking: 
            a non-profit project to re-create the story of Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim for 5th Edition D&D. Non-profit meaning I won't try to monetize this; it's for my 
            own non-commercial use.</p>
        <p>
            Now, after several years of throwing both finished and unfinished roleplaying game ideas and non-profit homebrew roleplaying products into literally random 
            places, in February 17th, 2023, I decided to – finally, with the heartfelt encouragement from my loving wife and multiple friends alike – gather all the 
            haywired ideas and concepts into one place, and under one name: Burnglade Creations. Now, in 2025, with this website assignment from my studies programme, I 
            plan to upload, or at least put a link to, everything I have created and will create in the future, in here.
        </p>

      <h3>Trivia: Where does the word "Burnglade" come from?</h3>
        <p>Painfully aware that my family name would be immensely difficult to spell and pronounce correctly by most of the non-finnish speaking 
           community world wide, I came up with the idea to translate my family name to plain english. In other words, the name Burnglade is a 
           translation from ‘Luoma-aho’<sup>[1]</sup>, which in turn is a combination of the archaic Finnish words for ‘stream’ and ‘slash-and-burn field’. 
           However, it turns out there is the word ‘burn’ which also has an archaic meaning for ‘stream’, and the word ‘aho’ also translates as 
           ‘glade’ – so, the idea of Burnglade Creations was born.</p>
        <p style="font-size:10px"><sup>[1]</sup>A literal and descriptive meaning for the word ‘luoma-aho’ would be “a small stream crossing a slash-and-burn field”, so naturally some artistic freedom has been used to form “burnglade”, as linguistically correct as possible.</p>

      <h1>Creations for Game Masters (a.k.a. Dungeon Masters)</h1>
        <h3>Universal Wild Magic System (5th edition Dungeons & Dragons)</h3>
          <p>This system introduces a universal Wild Magic mechanic, forcing any spellcaster—not just Wild Magic Sorcerers—to experience 
            unpredictable magical surges. Whenever a spell is cast, there's a chance a Wild Magic effect will occur, drawing from an expanded 
            table of chaotic and often surprising outcomes. This adds a layer of delightful unpredictability and dynamic challenge to all 
            magical endeavors, from a wizard's meticulously prepared incantation to a cleric's divine prayer.</p>
        <h3>The Epic 12 or "E12" system (5th edition Dungeons & Dragons)</h3>
          <p>The Epic 12, or "E12" system, is a variant for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition that adapts the philosophy of the 3rd Edition "E6" 
            (Epic 6) system. In E12, character advancement is capped at level 12 instead of the standard 20. Once a character reaches 12th level, 
            they no longer gain traditional class levels or hit points. Instead, continued experience points (XP) are used to gain epic feats, 
            powerful abilities, or other forms of specialized growth that enhance a character's existing capabilities without increasing their 
            overall power level exponentially.<br>This system aims to keep campaigns in the "heroic fantasy" tier of play, where characters are 
            powerful and capable, but don't reach the god-like abilities of high-level 5e. It encourages a focus on narrative progression, 
            strategic resource management, and facing formidable challenges that require clever planning and teamwork, rather than simply out-
            leveling threats. It maintains the grittier, more grounded feel of lower-level play while still allowing for significant character 
            development over a long campaign.</p>
        <h3>Modular Weapons (1st Edition Starfinder)</h3>
          <p>The Modular Weapons homebrew introduces a comprehensive system for building custom weapons from the ground 
            up, allowing players and GMs to mix and match various features and components. This system moves beyond the standard weapon fusions 
            and accessories found in the core rules, providing a framework for creating truly unique firearms, melee weapons, and advanced weaponry.
            <br>Instead of simply choosing pre-defined weapons, this homebrew empowers users to select a base weapon frame and then customize it 
            with a wide array of barrels, grips, firing mechanisms, energy cells, and special weapon properties (like automatic, critical effects, 
            or unique damage types). Each component or feature contributes to the weapon's overall statistics, such as damage, range, bulk, and 
            price, often utilizing a point-buy or attribute-based system to ensure balance.<br>The goal is to foster creativity and allow for 
            weapons that truly reflect a character's specific needs, style, or the unique manufacturing processes of a particular faction or 
            company within the Starfinder setting. This makes for a more personal connection to one's gear and opens up new possibilities for 
            crafting, scavenging, and upgrading weapons throughout a campaign.</p>
        <h3>Herbalism & Alchemy (1st Edition Pathfinder)</h3>
          <p>The Herbalism & Alchemy homebrew is a comprehensive system designed to replace traditional spellcasting with a more grounded and 
            realistic approach to magical effects, emphasizing verisimilitude over high fantasy. Instead of arcane incantations or divine intervention, 
            this system focuses on the meticulous gathering of natural reagents, precise alchemical processes, and the understanding of natural 
            properties to replicate magical phenomena.<br>Characters utilizing this system would spend significant time identifying and collecting 
            rare herbs, minerals, and other natural components from the environment. These raw materials are then processed through detailed alchemical 
            procedures, requiring specific tools, preparation times, and often successful skill checks (e.g., Craft (Alchemy), Knowledge (Nature), 
            Survival). The resulting concoctions, tinctures, poultices, and powders would then produce effects similar to spells, such as healing wounds, 
            creating illusions, influencing minds, or even causing elemental damage, but through a logical, scientific, and resource-intensive method.
            <br>This homebrew aims to immerse players in a world where magic is not an innate power for a select few, but a craft that anyone with 
            dedication, knowledge, and the right resources can master. It encourages exploration, resource management, and a deeper understanding of the 
            world's flora and fauna, providing a grittier and more tangible sense of accomplishment when "magical" effects are achieved. It fundamentally 
            alters the feel of a campaign, shifting it towards a more low-magic, survival-oriented, and craft-driven experience.</p>
