      <h1>History of Burnglade Creations</h1>
        <p>
            I've been playing table-top roleplaying games since around 2002–2003, when I started attending the local RPGA group’s Living Greyhawk 
            sessions at Domus Academica in Helsinki, where most of the older members of the local RPGA-branch were living at the time, and I have played every 
            edition of Dungeons & Dragons ever since, starting with 3rd edition, and as the group proceeded to the 3.5th edition update, I had little choice 
            other than tag along. Over the years, I have gathered extensive experience in the rules mechanics, rules interactions, and internal balance of 
            the game systems in the process (mostly with the aforementioned Dungeons & Dragons, but also some experience from White Wolf Publishing's Titles: "Exalted",
            "Mage: The Awakening", and "Werewolf", as well as Pathfinder 1st edition ever since beta playtest). Since late Pathfinder 1st edition, and approximately 
            a year after the release of Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition, in 2014, I started designing my own content (usually called as "Homebrew"), from full-blown 
            classes (e.g. the Warlord base class for 5th edition) and several subclasses (e.g. Thug and Inquisitor archetypes for 5th edition Rogue, as well Rage Mage 
            Primal Path for 5th edition Barbarian) to new rules mechanics themselves. In the advent of OneD&D playtest, I began my latest – and biggest – undertaking: 
            a non-profit project to re-create the story of Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim for 5th Edition D&D. Non-profit meaning I won't try to monetize this; it's for my 
            own non-commercial use.</p>
        <p>
            Now, after several years of throwing both finished and unfinished roleplaying game ideas and non-profit homebrew roleplaying products into literally random 
            places, in February 17th, 2023, I decided to – finally, with the heartfelt encouragement from my loving wife and multiple friends alike – gather all the 
            haywired ideas and concepts into one place, and under one name: Burnglade Creations. Now, in 2025, with this website assignment from my studies programme, I 
            plan to upload, or at least put a link to, everything I have created and will create in the future, in here.

      <h3>Trivia: Where does the word "Burnglade" come from?</h3>
        <p>Painfully aware that my family name would be immensely difficult to spell and pronounce correctly by most of the non-finnish speaking 
           community world wide, I came up with the idea to translate my family name to plain english. In other words, the name Burnglade is a 
           translation from ‘Luoma-aho’<sup>[1]</sup>, which in turn is a combination of the archaic Finnish words for ‘stream’ and ‘slash-and-burn field’. 
           However, it turns out there is the word ‘burn’ which also has an archaic meaning for ‘stream’, and the word ‘aho’ also translates as 
           ‘glade’ – so, the idea of Burnglade Creations was born.</p>
        <p style="font-size:10px"><sup>[1]</sup>A literal and descriptive meaning for the word ‘luoma-aho’ would be “a small stream crossing a slash-and-burn field”, so naturally some artistic freedom has been used to form “burnglade”, as linguistically correct as possible.</p>
