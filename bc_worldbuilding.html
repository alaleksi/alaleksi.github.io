      <h1>Worldbuilding & Campaign Setting lore</h1>
        <h3>Torn Horizon - Setting Overview (5th edition Dungeons & Dragons)</h3>
          <p>Torn Horizon is a gritty, post-cataclysmic survival fantasy setting where magic is unstable, technology is scavenged, and the world is a fractured 
            echo of its former self. Centuries ago, an arcane disaster known as the Tearing shattered reality itself, twisting the land, corrupting life, and 
            tearing open the skies. Civilization collapsed, leaving behind isolated vault-cities, mutant tribes, buried ruins, and dangerous wilderness plagued 
            by chaotic weather and warped magic.<br>The Native Species—mutated humans, surface scavengers, hardy dwarves, sociable halflings, bestial orcs, and 
            powerful hobgoblins—struggle to survive amidst scarce resources and lawless frontiers. Alien species like elves, gnomes, and element-touched "planars" 
            arrived after the Tearing through mysterious means, and while some are now tolerated, they remain objects of suspicion.<br>Magic is rare, dangerous, 
            and erratic—Conjuration and Evocation are lost arts. All spellcasting risks surging wild effects, echoing the chaos that caused the Tearing. Weather, 
            terrain, and even time can behave unpredictably, warped by lingering magical instability.<br>Hidden powers move behind the scenes. The enigmatic 
            Templars, blamed for the catastrophe, now seek to control knowledge and steer the world’s fate from the shadows. Their ancient rivals, the secretive 
            Bards, work to undermine them and protect forgotten truths.<br>Morality is ambiguous, survival is harsh, and alignment is meaningless. Trust is earned, 
            not assumed. Players take on the roles of survivors, wanderers, scavengers, and warriors in a broken world where every day is a fight to endure—and 
            where ancient secrets stir once more.</p>
        <h3>Aefw - Setting Overview (5th edition Dungeons & Dragons)</h3>
          <p>Aefw is a unique fantasy setting where the four fundamental elements—Air, Earth, Fire, and Water—are not just environmental forces, but the intrinsic 
            essence of its peoples. Every species on Aefw is an elemental genasi subtype, deeply connected to one of these core elements, shaping their cultures, 
            appearances, and abilities.<br>
            Elemental Lineages:<br>
            Water Orcs: Imagine a vibrant, seafaring culture reminiscent of Polynesian voyagers. These orcs possess an innate connection to the tides and the deep, 
            making them master navigators and explorers.<br>Fire Dwarves: Drawing inspiration from Mesopotamian civilizations, these are a hearty, resilient folk 
            with a profound connection to the forge and the earth's molten core. Their fiery spirit fuels their craftsmanship and enduring will.<br>Earth Halflings: 
            Grounded and deeply connected to the land, these halflings embody the spirit of Celtic traditions. They are often skilled in agriculture, possess a 
            strong sense of community, and have an inherent respect for nature.<br>Air Elves: These elves are nomadic, ethereal, and philosophical, intrinsically 
            linked to the winds and skies. They might be graceful stargazers, master archers, or swift messengers, their culture shaped by vast distances and the 
            constant flow of air.<br>Exceptional Human Origins:<br>
            Uniquely, Humans, Aasimars, and Tieflings stand apart from these elemental lineages. They share a common, non-elemental origin, with Humans being the 
            descendants of ancient Aasimar-Tiefling hybrids. This distinct ancestry suggests a fascinating and separate history, where celestial and infernal forces 
            ntermingled, setting them apart from the elemental cycle that defines the rest of Aefw's diverse inhabitants.<br>
            Aefw offers a rich tapestry for storytelling, exploring how these elemental ties and unique origins shape societies, conflicts, and the very magic of 
            the world.</p>
