        <h2>The brief history of Burnglade Creations</h2>
        <p>
            Ever since I was four years old, I have spent my freetime at the end of a pen and paper, mostly drawing, and since junior high school, 
            I have been writing my own short stories or novellas, and to some extent – although drawing has become a thing of the past – that same 
            spark for creation still lingers and drives me forward to this day.
        </p>
        <p>    
            I have been playing table-top roleplaying games since around 2002–2003, when I started attending the local RPGA group’s Living Greyhawk 
            sessions, and have played every edition of Dungeons & Dragons ever since, gathering extensive experience in the rules mechanics and 
            internal balance of the game systems in the process (mostly with Dungeons & Dragons, but also with White Wolf Publishing Exalted, Mage: 
            The Awakening, and Werewolf, as well as Pathfinder 1st edition ever since beta playtest). Since late Pathfinder 1st edition, and 
            approximately a year after the introduction of Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition in 2014, I began designing my own homebrew content, from 
            full-blown classes (Warlord base class for 5th edition) and several subclasses (Thug and Inquisitor archetypes for 5th edition Rogue, 
            and Rage Mage Primal Path for 5th edition Barbarian) to the rule mchanics themselves. In the advent of OneD&D playtest, I began my 
            latest – and biggest – undertaking: a non-profit project to re-create the story of Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim for 5th Edition D&D. For my 
            own use, of course.
            Now, after several years of throwing both finished and unfinished roleplaying game ideas and non-profit homebrew roleplaying products 
            into literally random places, in February 17th, 2023, I decided to – finally, with the heartfelt encouragement from my loving wife and 
            multiple friends alike – gather all the haywired ideas and concepts into one place, and under one name: Burnglade Creations.

        </p>
        <p>
            Painfully aware that my family name would be immensely difficult to spell and pronounce correctly by most of the non-finnish speaking 
            community world wide, I came up with the idea to translate my family name to plain english. In other words, the name Burnglade is a 
            translation from ‘Luoma-aho’<sup>[1]</sup>, which in turn is a combination of the archaic Finnish words for ‘stream’ and ‘slash-and-burn field’. 
            However, it turns out there is the word ‘burn’ which also has an archaic meaning for ‘stream’, and the word ‘aho’ also translates as 
            ‘glade’ – so, the idea of Burnglade Creations was born.
        </p>
        <p>            
            Thus, from this point forward, I aim to compile all of my  – past and future – creations under the name of Burnglade Creations.

        <p style="font-size:13px"><sup>[1]</sup>A literal and descriptive meaning for the word ‘luoma-aho’ would be “a small stream crossing a slash-and-burn field”, so naturally some artistic freedom has been used to form “burnglade”, as linguistically correct as possible.</p>
